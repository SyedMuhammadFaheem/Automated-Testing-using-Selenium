# Automated Testing using Selenium

Welcome to the Automated Testing using Selenium repository! This repository provides a sorting algorithm visualizer and includes two essential Python files: `defect.py` and `validation.py`.

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The sorting algorithm visualizer is a tool that takes a text file as input and sorts its contents. To ensure proper functionality, please adhere to the following guidelines for the format of the text file:

```
1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 5
```

## Automated Test Files

Within this repository, you will find two separate files dedicated to automated testing: `defect.py` and `validation.py`. Let's explore their purposes:

### Defect Testing

The `defect.py` file focuses on defect testing. It identifies and reports errors if the input file consists of incorrect data that cannot be sorted properly. This test ensures the reliability and accuracy of the sorting algorithm.

### Validation Testing

The `validation.py` file is dedicated to validation testing. It verifies whether the data entered through a file has been sorted successfully. This test confirms the correctness of the sorting algorithm.

## Sample Files

To facilitate testing with both correct and incorrect data types, we have included two sample files for your convenience:

- `input.txt`: This file can be used to test the sorting algorithm with correctly formatted data.
- `inputw.txt`: This file is specifically designed to test the sorting algorithm's handling of incorrect data types.
